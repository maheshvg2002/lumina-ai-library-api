The concept of artificial neural networks didn't begin in the 21st century; it has roots stretching back to the 1940s. Warren McCulloch and Walter Pitts created the first computational model for neural networks based on mathematics and algorithms. They called it threshold logic. This early theoretical work paved the way for the perceptron in 1958, invented by Frank Rosenblatt. While early computers lacked the processing power to make these networks truly useful, the underlying architecture—nodes mimicking human brain neurons, passing weighted signals to one another—remained conceptually brilliant. It wasn't until the advent of massive parallel computing and the explosion of digital data in the 2010s that these foundational algorithms finally woke up, launching the modern deep learning revolution.
